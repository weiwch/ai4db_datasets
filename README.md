# ai4db_datasets

Datasets used by pilotscope for AI4DB tasks, including TPC-H, STATS-CEB and IMDB. We import data files of various formats into PostgreSQL and then dump them into a single SQL file then compressing them. Please refer to the files in the [release](https://github.com/weiwch/ai4db_datasets/releases).
